                    <p>
                        This is a small project, create to study more about React, 
                        and how to consume APIs, my idea was create something small and fast, 
                        simulating the normal development process of a web project.
                    </p>

                        first autoral project, please if you have any suggestion let me know, but keep in mind that it's a study case.
